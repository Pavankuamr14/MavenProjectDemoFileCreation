# Introduction  
This README provides an overview of Maven commands, focusing on the use of goals and phases, along with a description of the project structure created using `mvn archetype:generate`.

# Maven Commands Overview  

## Goals and Phases  
Maven operates through a series of **goals** and **phases** that dictate how projects are built and managed:  
- **Goals**: Specific tasks contributing to the build process, such as compiling code or packaging applications.  
- **Phases**: Stages in the build lifecycle. Invoking a phase executes all preceding phases in sequence.  

## Common Maven Commands  
Below are some commonly used Maven commands:  

| Command                     | Description                                                                         |  
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| `mvn archetype:generate`    | Generates a new project from an archetype template.                                 |  
| `mvn clean`                 | Cleans the project by removing all files generated by previous builds.              |  
| `mvn compile`               | Compiles the source code of the project.                                           |  
| `mvn test`                  | Runs tests for the project.                                                        |  
| `mvn package`               | Packages the compiled code into a distributable format (e.g., JAR/WAR).            |  
| `mvn install`               | Installs the packaged JAR/WAR file into the local repository for use as a dependency. |  
| `mvn site`                  | Generates project documentation based on the POM file.                             |  

# Explanation of Key Terms  
- **Group ID**: A unique identifier for your project's group, typically following reverse domain name conventions (e.g., `com.example`).  / But i have used GroupID as MavenProjectDemo for initial learning purpose
- **Artifact ID**: The name of the project (e.g., `myproject`).  / I have given my project name as MavenProjectDemo
- **Version**: A version number for your project (e.g., `1.0-SNAPSHOT`).  / for starting of project I have mentioned as project version as 1.0-SNAPSHOT
- **Snapshot**: A special version indicating ongoing development; it can change frequently.

To create a new Maven project skeleton, use the following command:  

```bash  
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example.MavenProjectDemo -DartifactId=MavenProjectDemo -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
```

# Command Breakdown
archetype:generate: This command initiates the creation of a new project from an archetype.
-DgroupId=com.example: Sets the group ID for your project.
-DartifactId=myproject: Sets the artifact ID for your project.
-Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT: Specifies the version of your project as a snapshot.
-DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart: Uses the quickstart archetype to create a simple Java application structure.
-DinteractiveMode=false: Runs the command in batch mode, avoiding interactive prompts.
